# CircleCI emoji circa March 2020
This repo contains:
1. Stahnma's emoji grabber.
2. The CircleCI emoji circa March 2020.
3. A not-very-up-to-date shortlist of emoji that Hannah uses. She would modify the selection slightly, but is feeling lazy and is only updating this readme as she has made this repo public for the first time ever.

Please use responsibly, especially for spreading joy and vibes.

# Bulk uploading emoji
This tool works, you can install it and then uninstall it as soon as you're done:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/neutral-face-emoji-tools/anchoacphlfbdomdlomnbbfhcmcdmjej?hl=en

For awhile, you needed to have at least one custom emoji in your Slack in order to get the drag-and-drop functionality of "Neutral Face Emoji Tools" to register.
